# Labor Discrimination Patterns Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the course **PP3106 – Fundamentals of Psychology for Artificial Intelligence** at the **Universidad del Valle de Guatemala**.

The main objective is to identify patterns of labor discrimination across industries based on demographic variables such as **age**, **education**, **occupation**, **salary**, and more. The analysis supports the implementation of **strategic action plans** aimed at promoting diversity, equity, and economic growth in alignment with **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #8**: *“Decent Work and Economic Growth.”*

By using data visualization techniques, this dashboard aims to provide insights into how different social groups are distributed across the labor market and whether there are hidden barriers affecting specific populations.
